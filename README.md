# ‚öΩ Football Injury Prediction with Neural Networks & Deep Learning

Welcome to the Football Injury Prediction NNDL Project! üß†üí•

## What is this?
This project is a data-driven adventure into the world of football (soccer) injuries. Using real player data and advanced machine learning, we predict when a player might get injured, helping teams stay ahead of the game!

## Why Predict Injuries?
Injuries can change the course of a season. By predicting them, clubs can:
- Protect their star players
- Plan better strategies
- Save money on medical bills
- Win more matches!

## How Does It Work?
We use two powerful AI models:
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** Like a football coach with a great memory, LSTM looks at a player‚Äôs history and spots patterns over time.
- **Medical ANN (Artificial Neural Network):** Inspired by medical experts, this model understands complex health data and predicts risks.

## What‚Äôs in the Data?
Our dataset includes:
- Player stats (minutes played, games, age, position)
- Injury records (days injured, previous injuries)
- Physical attributes (height, weight, BMI)
- FIFA ratings and more!

## The Magic Recipe
1. **Data Cleaning:** We tidy up the stats, fill in missing info, and get everything match-ready.
2. **Feature Engineering:** We create new features (like injury trends) to help our models learn better.
3. **Model Training:** LSTM and ANN learn from the data, just like players learn from practice.
4. **Prediction:** The models predict injury risk for each player and season.

## Why LSTM & Medical ANN?
- **LSTM** is perfect for time-series data (like player history).
- **Medical ANN** is great for health-related predictions.
- Other models (like CNNs) are better for images, but we need brains, not eyes!

## Results
- Accurate injury predictions
- Insights for coaches and medical staff
- A fun way to combine football and AI!
