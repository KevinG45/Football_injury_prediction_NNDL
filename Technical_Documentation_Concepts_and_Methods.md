## Overview

This document provides comprehensive technical documentation for the Football Injury Prediction Neural Network and Deep Learning (NNDL) system. The project implements multiple machine learning and deep learning approaches to predict football player injuries using historical data.

**Core Problem**: Predict football player injury severity and duration using multi-seasonal player data while preventing data leakage and ensuring medical validity.

## Neural Network Architectures

### 1. Dense Neural Networks (Medical ANN)

**Architecture**: Multi-layer perceptron with configurable depth and width
- **Input Layer**: 13 features (engineered from raw data)
- **Hidden Layers**: 3 configurable layers (default: 128→64→32 neurons)
- **Output Layer**: 1 neuron (sigmoid for classification, linear for regression)

**Why We Use It**:
- Excellent for tabular data with complex non-linear relationships
- Can capture interactions between player characteristics and injury risk
- Suitable for medical prediction tasks where interpretability is important

**Key Components**:
```python
# Example architecture
model = Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(13,)),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Dropout(0.2),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Dropout(0.1),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # For classification
])
```

### 2. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks

## Optimizers

### 1. Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)

**Mathematical Foundation**:
- Combines momentum and adaptive learning rates
- Maintains moving averages of gradients and squared gradients
- Default choice for most deep learning applications

**Why We Use It**:
- Fast convergence on medical datasets
- Handles sparse gradients well (common in injury data)
- Self-adjusting learning rate reduces hyperparameter tuning
- Robust to different scales of input features

**Implementation**:
```python
optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=0.001)  # Default
```

**Best For**: General-purpose optimization, initial model development

### 2. RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation)

**Mathematical Foundation**:
- Adaptive learning rate method
- Divides learning rate by exponentially decaying average of squared gradients
- Developed specifically for neural networks

**Why We Use It**:
- Excellent for recurrent networks (LSTM)
- Handles non-stationary objectives well
- Good for medical time-series data
- Less memory intensive than Adam

**Best For**: LSTM models, when computational resources are limited

### 3. SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) with Momentum

**Mathematical Foundation**:
- Classical optimization method with momentum term
- Momentum helps accelerate convergence and escape local minima

**Why We Use It**:
- Simple and interpretable
- Often provides better generalization than adaptive methods
- Good baseline for comparison
- Sometimes finds better final solutions with proper tuning

**Implementation**:
```python
optimizer = SGD(learning_rate=0.001, momentum=0.9)
```

**Best For**: Well-understood problems, when interpretability is crucial

## Loss Functions and Metrics

### Classification Metrics

#### 1. Binary Cross-Entropy Loss
**Formula**: `-Σ[y*log(ŷ) + (1-y)*log(1-ŷ)]`

**Why We Use It**:
- Standard for binary classification (injured/not injured)
- Provides probability estimates for medical decision-making
- Differentiable for gradient-based optimization

#### 2. Area Under ROC Curve (AUC)
**Range**: 0.5 (random) to 1.0 (perfect)

**Medical Interpretation**:
- **0.60-0.75**: Realistic for injury prediction (achieved ~0.598)
- **0.50-0.60**: Features may need improvement
- **>0.90**: May indicate overfitting

**Why Important**: Threshold-independent metric crucial for medical screening

#### 3. Sensitivity and Specificity
**Sensitivity** (True Positive Rate): Ability to correctly identify injuries
**Specificity** (True Negative Rate): Ability to correctly identify non-injuries

**Medical Relevance**:
- High sensitivity: Don't miss actual injuries (safety priority)
- High specificity: Avoid unnecessary interventions (cost consideration)

### Regression Metrics

#### 1. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
**Why We Use It**: Standard for regression, penalizes large errors heavily

#### 2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
**Why We Use It**: More robust to outliers, interpretable in days injured

#### 3. R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
**Medical Interpretation**:
- **0.1-0.3**: Typical for injury prediction (complex biological systems)
- **<0.1**: Very challenging prediction task
- **>0.5**: Very good (rare in medical prediction)

## Regularization Techniques

### 1. Dropout
**Mechanism**: Randomly sets neurons to zero during training

**Why We Use It**:
- Prevents overfitting in deep networks
- Simulates ensemble learning
- Particularly important for medical data (limited samples)

**Configuration**:
- Layer 1: 30% dropout (aggressive to prevent early overfitting)
- Layer 2: 20% dropout (moderate)
- Layer 3: 10% dropout (light, near output)

### 2. Batch Normalization
**Mechanism**: Normalizes inputs to each layer

**Why We Use It**:
- Stabilizes training of deep networks
- Allows higher learning rates
- Reduces internal covariate shift
- Acts as implicit regularization

**Medical Benefits**:
- Handles different scales of medical measurements
- Improves convergence on small medical datasets

### 3. Early Stopping
**Mechanism**: Stops training when validation performance stops improving

**Why We Use It**:
- Prevents overfitting on limited medical data
- Automatic hyperparameter (number of epochs)
- Computationally efficient

### 4. Class Weights
**Mechanism**: Assigns higher weights to minority class samples

**Why We Use It**:
- Handles imbalanced injury data (12.2% severe injuries)
- Ensures model learns from rare but important cases
- Critical for medical applications where missing positives is costly

---

## Data Processing Methods

### 1. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
**Mechanism**: Generates synthetic examples of minority class

**Why We Use It**:
- Addresses class imbalance (severe injuries are rare)
- Creates realistic synthetic injury cases
- Improves model sensitivity to injury patterns

**Implementation**:
```python
# Applied ONLY to training data to prevent data leakage
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42, k_neighbors=min(5, minority_count-1))
X_train_balanced, y_train_balanced = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
# Test set remains unchanged
```

### 2. Feature Scaling (StandardScaler)
**Mechanism**: Standardizes features to mean=0, std=1

**Why We Use It**:
- Neural networks sensitive to input scale
- Medical measurements have different units (age in years, BMI in kg/m²)
- Improves optimization convergence

### 3. Data Leakage Prevention
**Critical Principle**: Test data must remain unseen during training

**Implementation**:
- SMOTE applied only to training data
- Feature scaling fitted only on training data
- Temporal/player-based splits prevent information leakage

---

## Model Validation Techniques

### 1. Temporal Split
**Mechanism**: Uses earlier seasons for training, later for testing

**Why We Use It**:
- Mimics real-world deployment (predict future from past)
- Prevents data leakage in time-series data
- Most realistic validation for injury prediction

**Results**: Train years [2019-2022], Test year [2023]

### 2. Player Split
**Mechanism**: Different players in training vs testing sets

**Why We Use It**:
- Tests generalization to new players
- Prevents learning player-specific patterns
- Realistic for scouting new players

**Results**: 208 train players, 52 test players

### 3. Stratified Random Split
**Mechanism**: Maintains class distribution across splits

**Why We Use It**:
- Baseline comparison method
- Ensures balanced injury rates in both sets
- Standard ML practice (but may allow temporal leakage)
